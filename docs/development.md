## Languaje/Frameworks/Libraries:

* Oracle [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/): Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). Gradle is a build automation tool for multi-language software development. It controls the development process in the tasks of compilation and packaging to testing, deployment, and publishing.
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/): The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.
* [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/): Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a free and open-source cross-platform data format used to serialize structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a network or for storing data. The method involves an interface description language that describes the structure of some data and a program that generates source code from that description for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data.
* [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/): MapStruct is a code generator that greatly simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types based on a convention over configuration approach.
* Jetbrains [IntelliJ Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/): IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java for developing computer software written in Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages.
